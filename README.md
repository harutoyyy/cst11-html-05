# Tables, Blocks and Dynamic Changes

We will be introducting 3 topics today, but not looking at each of them in much detail:
* tables
* display blocks
* dynamic changes to styles

# Tables
Tables used to be used quite a lot for organizing web pages, but this has fallen out of favor since the inception of Styles for layouts.  Tables are still great for organizing data, and we can style them as well.

Open the file tables.html and look at the content.
This is a pretty boring table, with no additions.  However, we are going to add a whole lot of styles all at once.
Add the following text into your <head></head>
```
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="tablestyle.css">
 ```
 This adds an external document into your html.  It is a way of importing your styles from another file.  Open up tablestyle.css and see what it looks like.

 ## Assignment
 Visit https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp to see more examples of styles with tables.  Open the file tableassignment.html.  There is some text data here. Your assignment is to add the html and style this page to create a more esthetically appealing page.


 # Display Blocks
 We are only going to touch on these briefly, just to see an alternative to layers. Open the file: blocks.html
 Notice the intoduction of nested <div> tags to organize the page into sections.  We will use blocks more later on in this course after we introduce some programming basics

 # Dynamic Style Changes
Scripting languages can be used to modify a page dynamically.  Doing so requires the use of Javascript.  We can use core javascript, or we can use a wrapper.  If you open the document dynamic.html, you will see an example of core javascript as well as the use of a wrapper called Jquery.  

## Assignment
Add some buttons to the document.html page and create some styles that you can change dynamically.
